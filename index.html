      <h3><p> Well we made it. It has been 1 year since we started dating and it has been amazing. When i first ment you it was becuase of cody since
        you guys were friends. We started walking together even without cody. I always talked alot and told you all kinds of storys. I always thought
        you were really cute but I did not think I even had a chance with you.</p> The first time I really knew I liked you was when i would tell you a story
        and a cfew days later you would bring the story up, which is when I really thought holy cow she is acttaly lisening to me. That ment so much to me
        becasue I always feel that when I tell someone a story that are not really listening which makes me feel like im being anoyying. you were different
        though, you listen to everyone of my storys and even asked me almost everyday how fittness class was. Everyday I always looked forward
        to talking to you and seeing you. I loved walking by you in the hall and we just both say each others name really agressivly which was my form of flirting.
        Then we went though a stage of not really seeing each other which really sucked. John would always ask me if you and I were dating yet and i would say no and my face whould just get
        really red or i just would not say anything. <p>He 100% new i really liked you and he would bring you up all the time. I thought i would never 
        be in a realationship the rest of my highschool cereer. I went to prom my junior year and it was horrible just looking around and seeing all these happy couples
        and what did i have a few frineds that were there with there girlfrineds. it was just an all around big mess. The my senior year comes around
        and everyone was saying how it is going to be the best year of my life and man were they right. I was so ready to be done with highschool. Then homecoming comes around and at first it was horrible
           the person I went with ended up getting a boyfriend and so i was all alone.</p> Then cruz started talking to be and to be honest i noticed you at the dance and i wanted 
        to sya hi but I thought you had a date you went with. Then here comes sydney and she told me that i should go up to you and ask if you wanted to dance next slow dance. \
        At first I was like no way am i going to have the guts to go up to her but i dont know what came over me but i got up and asked you. when yousay yes
        I went and sat down and i was justso surprissed and mind blown i was questioning if this was real or not. I was so happy that i just could not stop smiling.
        Then after our last dance cruz texted me saying that you really like me, then he asked if I liked you and I told him yes that i have liked you for awhile,
        not knowing he was showing you the text messages. Then you went u to me and told me you are leaving and if you can have my phone number. I was sad that you
        were leaving but happy that i knew we were going to talk again. Then we started dating and i was in heaven. as the months went by i fell in love with you
        more and more. Now we are at a year and i could not be any happier. Thank you for always being their for me and loving me for me. i know i can
        be myself around you and that means the world to me. I love you more then anything in the world and I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.
        Always and forever. I love you Hayley.</h3>
